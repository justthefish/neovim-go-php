neovim golang and php config
===

This is an early aplha - but the time to move from vim 7.x has come.

    Requirements: 
     - neovim >= 0.3.*
     - ack-grep
     - fzf (tries to be installed automatically)

     What fails:    
    - Deoplete on PHP works strange in some cases
    - Python, CPP support missing

To start deopleting - create file .phpcd.vim ith content like this:

```
let g:phpcd_autoload_path='vendor/autoload.php'
```

file contains path to autoload files generated by composer.


```
git clone https://github.com/justthefish/neovim-go-php.git ~/.config/nvim
```
After than run
```
~/.config/nvim/vim-plug.sh      
```
then 
```
vi
:PlugInstall
```

Rebuild vim-polyglot

```
cd ~/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-polyglot
./build
```

then

```
vi
:GoInstallBinaries
```
